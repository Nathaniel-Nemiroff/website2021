this project is meant to be the face of my resume and my portfolio, I guess

could do it in another language, but I can slot in a different MVC later...django is alright anyway

content that goes in:
	resume
		image of me :)
	github content
		image of example
		descriptions
		link to github repo

	and some fun stuff if I get around to it


THIS SHOULD NOT BE COMPLICATED, JUST STAY FOCUSED AND IT CAN GET DONE!


maybe I should install a light weight OS....I could do that rn tbh.

yeah, actually, why not?

cuz I should be working on work stuff....and ubuntu is fine for now, dont' worry about it
